# Understanding causal relationships between variables and interpreting models

## Task 1: Causal Relationships and Kidney Stone Treatment
### Objective: 
Explore causal relationships between variables related to kidney stone treatments.
### Steps:
Calculate the probabilities of kidney stone removal success with old and new treatments.
Compute the causal effects using the do operator to understand the impact of treatments.
## Task 2: Algorithmic Recourse for Loan Applications
### Objective: 
Use causal models to determine recourse actions for two individuals who are denied a loan.
### Steps:
Analyze the causal relationships and use algorithmic recourse methods to find the minimal changes needed to approve the loan.
Compare the changes for the two individuals and their associated costs.
## Task 3: Airline Operations Management
### Objective:
Analyze data related to airline operations and identify the causal relationships between different factors such as ticket prices, sales, and marketing efforts.
### Steps:
Create a causal graph using the given features (e.g., ticket price, sales revenue).
Build a structural causal model (SCM) and determine how much each factor contributes to the airline's profitability.
Investigate the variance in profit and determine which variables have the most significant impact.
## Task 4: Effect of Age on Insulin and Blood Glucose Levels
### Objective: 
Estimate the causal impact of age, insulin levels, and blood glucose levels on health outcomes.
### Steps:
Use logistic regression on the provided health dataset to compute the required expectations.
Identify and prove the effect of insulin on blood glucose using the calculated values.
## Task 5: Counterfactual Explanation and Algorithmic Recourse in Health Data
### Objective:
Design a classifier to separate healthy and unhealthy individuals and apply counterfactual explanation methods.
### Steps:
Process the health dataset and focus on actionable variables such as insulin, blood glucose, and blood pressure.
Use Nearest Counterfactual Explanation and Causal Algorithmic Recourse methods to suggest interventions for unhealthy individuals to become healthy.
Compare the costs of the two methods and identify which approach is more effective.
